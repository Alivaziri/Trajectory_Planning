# Trajectory_Planning
Firstly, I planned a trajectory for robot joint’s motion using polynomial method. The initial and final location of the end-effector was input. And also, the motion was limited in time. I wrote a function in MATLAB and used it in my robot’s model. The motion of robot’s joints was the output.
Furthermore, a model was developed in Simulink using LSPB method. The initial and final location of the end-effector was input. Velocity and acceleration were limited and the path of end effector was a straight line. The motion of joints and end effector was the output.
